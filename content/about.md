Hi, I am Yu-Chuan Hung, but you can call me Raymond if you prefer.

Currently, I work as a data engineer and am continuously learning many aspects of data engineering. This includes data 
orchestration tools, streaming processing platforms (e.g., Apache Kafka), and NoSQL databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra). 
This blog is a place where I record my learning experiences and side projects.

Since 2019, I have been immersed in academia, working as a full-time research assistant. The primary duties of this job 
involve cleaning and analyzing data from various sources, as well as managing tasks related to participants. These tasks 
are time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these challenges, I proactively started learning Python, R, and SQL 
to reduce working time and enhance performance. As my experience accumulated, I discovered my interest in data cleaning 
and processing, and in ensuring data quality. Consequently, I left my job and enrolled in the AppWorks School Batch #21 
Data Engineering class in July 2023.

AppWorks School is a training facility for programmers where trainees are required to figure out everything on their own
during a five-month program. Starting from the STYLiSH project, through collaboration with other trainees in the 
front-end and/or back-end classes, to personal projects, the training is intensely practical. After completing this 
extensive training, students are well-equipped to solve the problems they encounter.
